\
Author: Raquel Rios\
\
\
##Objectives\
\
To demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set by submitting:\
\
	1) a tidy data set \
	2) a link to  Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and\
	3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data. \
	\
##Data\
\
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:\

##Assignment\
\
Student have to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:\
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.\
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.\
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\
